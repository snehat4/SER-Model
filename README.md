# SER-Model
Speech Emotion Recognition using ML and DL models.
This project classifies six human emotions—anger, disgust, sadness, happiness, neutrality, and fear—using only speech audio. It leverages machine learning and deep learning models, including SVM, CNN, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing approach. Feature extraction techniques such as MFCCs, Spectral Contrast, and RMSE were used to improve model accuracy.
Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, OpenCV
Machine Learning: SVM, CNN, Gradient Boosting
Feature Extraction: MFCCs, Spectral Contrast, RMSE
