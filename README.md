# SER-Model
Speech Emotion Recognition using ML and DL models.
This project classifies six human emotions—anger, disgust, sadness, happiness, neutrality, and fear—using only speech audio. The dataset used was CREMA-D dataset which contains 7000 .wav audio files and 7000 .mp3 audio files. It leverages machine learning and deep learning models, including SVM, CNN, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing approach. Feature extraction techniques such as MFCCs, Spectral Contrast, and RMSE were used to improve model accuracy.
Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, OpenCV
Machine Learning: SVM, CNN, Gradient Boosting
Feature Extraction: MFCCs, Spectral Contrast, RMSE
